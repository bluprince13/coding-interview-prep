# Coding challenges

This is a collection of coding challenges that I've solved.

One file per challenge.

Links to the challenge (e.g. on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com)) are
provided at the top of each file. Each file contains my solution, comments,
and also unit tests to check the solution.

Solutions may not be in a polished state. However, if you want me to explain a
particular solution better, just ask me. :)
